# Angular Studies | Advanced Components

This self-directed study project showcases several advanced features in using Angular's built-in directives and in Angular + Typescript components development including styling components (with encapsulation), modifying host DOM elements, modifying templates with content projection, accessing directives, using lifecycle hooks, and detecting changes.

Tip: use --inline-style=true --inline-template=true flags when generating an app or a component so that CSS and HTML files aren't generated if writing the CSS and HTML inline, in the component file.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3 and upgraded to version 18.2.13.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
